What does it mean to have a mental illness?,"Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a personâ€™s thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life.
Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital.
It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a personâ€™s character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brainâ€™s biology.
Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."
Who does mental illness affect?,"It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background.
Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children.
Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition.
Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their childâ€™s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."

Can people with mental illness recover?,"When healing from mental illness, early identification and treatment are of vital importance. Based on the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment, it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process.
Many people with mental illnesses who are diagnosed and treated respond well, although some might experience a return of symptoms. Even in such cases, with careful monitoring and management of the disorder, it is still quite possible to live a fulfilled and productive life."
What should I do if I know someone who appears to have the symptoms of a mental disorder?,"Although this website cannot substitute for professional advice, we encourage those with symptoms to talk to their friends and family members and seek the counsel of a mental health professional. The sooner the mental health condition is identified and treated, the sooner they can get on the path to recovery.
If you know someone who is having problems, don't assume that the issue will resolve itself. Let them know that you care about them, and that there are treatment options available that will help them heal. Speak with a mental health professional or counselor if you think your friend or family member is experiencing the symptoms of a mental health condition. If the affected loved one knows that you support them, they will be more likely to seek out help."
How can I find a mental health professional for myself or my child?,Feeling comfortable with the professional you or your child is working with is critical to the success of the treatment. Finding the professional who best fits your needs may require research. Start by searching for providers in your area.
What treatment options are available?,"Just as there are different types of medications for physical illness, different treatment options are available for individuals with mental illness. Treatment works differently for different people. It is important to find what works best for you or your child."
"If I become involved in treatment, what do I need to know?","Since beginning treatment is a big step for individuals and families, it can be very overwhelming. It is important to be as involved and engaged in the treatment process as possible. Some questions you will need to have answered include:
What is known about the cause of this particular illness?
Are there other diagnoses where these symptoms are common?
Do you normally include a physical or neurological examination?
Are there any additional tests or exams that you would recommend at this point?
Would you advise an independent opinion from another psychiatrist at this point?
What program of treatment is the most helpful with this diagnosis?
Will this program involve services by other specialists? If so, who will be responsible for coordinating these services?
What do you see as the familyâ€™s role in this program of treatment?
How much access will the family have to the individuals who are providing the treatment?
What medications are generally used with this diagnosis?
How much experience do you have in treating individuals with this illness?
What can I do to help you in the treatment?"
What is the difference between mental health professionals?,"There are many types of mental health professionals. The variety of providers and their services may be confusing. Each have various levels of education, training, and may have different areas of expertise. Finding the professional who best fits your needs may require some research."
How can I find a mental health professional right for my child or myself?,Feeling comfortable with the professional you or your child is working with is critical to the success of your treatment. Finding the professional who best fits your needs may require some research.
If I become involved in treatment what do I need to know?,"Beginning treatment is a big step for individuals and families and can be very overwhelming. It is important to continue involvement in the treatment process as much as possible. Some questions you will need to have answered include:
What is known about the cause of this particular illness?
Are there other diagnoses where these symptoms are common?
Do you normally include a physical or neurological examination?
Are there any additional tests or exams that you would recommend at this point?

What do you see as the familyâ€™s role in this program of treatment?
How much access will the family have to the individuals who are providing the treatment?
What medications are generally used with this diagnosis? What is the biological effect of this medication, and what do you expect it to accomplish? What are the risks associated with the medication? How soon will we be able to tell if the medication is effective, and how will we know?
How much experience do you have in treating individuals with this illness?
What can I do to help you in the treatment?"
Where else can I get help?,"Where you go for help will depend on the nature of the problem and/or symptoms and what best fits you. Often, the best place to start is by talking with someone you trust about your concerns, such as a family member, friend, clergy, healthcare provider, or other professionals. Having this social support is essential in healing from mental illness, and you will be able to ask them for referrals or recommendations for trusted mental health practitioners. Search for mental health resources in your area.
Secondly, there are people and places throughout Nebraska that provide services to talk, to listen, and to help you on your journey to recovery. Thirdly, many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid in their recovery. There are a variety of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their family members, and friends. Some support groups are peer led while others may be led by a mental health professional."
What should I know before starting a new medication?,"The best source of information regarding medications is the physician prescribing them. He or she should be able to answer questions such as:    1. What is the medication supposed to do? 2. When should it begin to take effect, and how will I know when it is effective? 3. How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication? 4. What are the side effects and what should be done if they occur? 5. What do I do if a dose is missed? 6. Is there any written information available about this medication? 7. Are there other medications that might be appropriate? 8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen? 9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed? 10. All medications should be taken as directed. Most medications for mental illnesses do not work when taken irregularly, and extra doses can cause severe, sometimes dangerous side effects. Many psychiatric medications begin to have a beneficial effect only after they have been taken for several weeks."
"If I feel better after taking medication, does this mean I am ""cured"" and can stop taking it?","It is not uncommon for people to stop taking their medication when they feel their symptoms are under control. Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment.\nAnother problem with stopping medication, particularly for stopping it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that can be very unpleasant. If you and your doctor feel a trial off your medicine is a good idea, it is necessary to slowly decrease the dosage of medications so that these symptoms don’t occur.\nIt is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively. You should talk with them about how you are doing and if there are side effects that make you unwilling to continue treatment. They will work with you to develop strategies for minimizing these side effects, or will create a plan for switching to a different treatment that will be a better fit."
How can I get help paying for my medication?,"Some pharmaceutical companies offer prescription assistance programs to individuals and families with financial needs, while others offer special drug discount cards. These programs typically require a doctor’s consent and proof of your financial status. They may also require that you have either no health insurance or no prescription drug benefit through your health insurance.\nIn addition, there are prescription programs you might qualify for. Visit Healthfinder.gov to learn more."
Where can I go to find therapy,"Different kinds of therapy are more effective based on the nature of the mental health condition and/or symptoms and the person who has them (for example, children will benefit from a therapist who specializes in children’s mental health). However, there are several different types of treatment and therapy that can help."
Where can I learn about types of mental health treatment?,"Mental health conditions are often treated with medication, therapy or a combination of the two. However, there are many different types of treatment available, including Complementary & Alternative Treatments, self-help plans, and peer support. Treatments are very personal and should be discussed by the person with the mental health conditions and his or her team."
What are the different types of mental health professionals?,There are many types of mental health professionals. Finding the right one for you may require some research.
Where can I go to find a support group?,"Many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid in their recovery. There are a variety of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their family members and friends. Some support groups are peer-led, while others may be led by a mental health professional."
Where can I go to find inpatient care?,"If you or someone you know is in crisis, inpatient care can help. Inpatient care can help people stabilize on new medications, adjust to new symptoms, or get the help they need."
Where can I go to find other local services?,"There are likely plenty of resources that can be used to help you find mental health treatment in your community. These resources can help you find the right therapist, and enable you to better understand viable treatment options and the treatment process."
Where can I learn more information about clinical trials?,"Sometimes, consumers of mental health services may consider participating in a research study when they have not experienced improvement despite having tried a variety of medications and treatments. Research studies (also known as clinical trials) may involve the use of new medications or new treatment approaches whose safety and effectiveness is being tested. While we support innovation in the field, consumers should be cautioned that there are risks associated with clinical trials – make sure you’re aware of them before you enroll."
Where can I learn more information about creating a Psychiatric Advance Directive?,"Similar to a medical advance directive or a health care power of attorney, a psychiatric advance directive is a legal document completed in a time of wellness that provides instructions regarding treatment or services one wishes to have or not have during a mental health crisis, and may help influence his or her care."
What is mental health?,"We all have mental health which is made up of our beliefs, thoughts, feelings and behaviours."
What do I do if the support doesn’t help?,"It can be difficult to find the things that will help you, as different things help different people. It's important to be open to a range of approaches and to be committed to finding the right help and to continue to be hopeful, even when some things don't work out."
Can you prevent mental health problems?,"We can all suffer from mental health challenges, but developing our wellbeing, resilience, and seeking help early can help prevent challenges becoming serious."
Are there cures for mental health problems?,"It is often more realistic and helpful to find out what helps with the issues you face. Talking, counselling, medication, friendships, exercise, good sleep and nutrition, and meaningful occupation can all help."
What causes mental health problems?,"Challenges or problems with your mental health can arise from psychological, biological, and social, issues, as well as life events."
What do I do if I’m worried about my mental health?,"The most important thing is to talk to someone you trust. This might be a friend, colleague, family member, or GP. In addition to talking to someone, it may be useful to find out more information about what you are experiencing. These things may help to get some perspective on what you are experiencing, and be the start of getting help."
How do I know if I’m unwell?,"If your beliefs , thoughts , feelings or behaviours have a significant impact on your ability to function in what might be considered a normal or ordinary way, it would be important to seek help."
What should I do if I’m worried about a friend or relative?,This may depend on your relationship with them. Gently encouraging someone to seek appropriate support would be helpful to start with.
How do I deal with someone telling me what to do?,"Some people may advise you on good evidence of what works with the best of intentions, but it's important to find out what works best for you."
Why do I need to keep informed?,"It may be tempting to try to block out the world altogether to avoid bad news, but it's important to keep yourself informed. We all have to step up during a pandemic because we all have a part to play in reducing the spread of the virus. It's important that you know what must be done and how you should do it. This is important for the health of your neighbours and your own mental health, and taking action can help counter difficult feelings like hopelessness and despair. 
 One study from people in China found that people who had reliable up-to-date information about the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness and accurate instructions on how they should act (such as instructions around hand-washing and wearing a mask) felt more resilient and felt better able to handle the virus. People who received good, accurate information reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This research is available for free at www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1729. 
 Of course, it's okay to set limits. Staying informed does not mean that you have to follow the news all day. Check in a few times a day, sticking to trusted sources and media outlets. While social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, social media can also amplify bad advice, vague or untrue stories, and other unhelpful information. Be sure to use good critical thinking skills."
How can I tell if health information is good or bad?,"Anyone can post anything online. It's up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful, truthful, or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test. 
 It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source. 
 Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. 
 Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. 
 Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. 
 Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? 
 Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like ""Skyrocketing rates of infection"" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like ""We have 50 new cases in BC"" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. 
 Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? 
 Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. 
 Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information.

Why do I need a plan?,"There are a lot of things you can't control. You can't control what happens next, how governments respond, or how your neighbours react to the pandemic. What you can do is make a plan and decide how you'll manage the things you do control, like your ability to stay safe, follow public health measures, stay connected with loved ones, and take care of your mental and physical health. 
 Events like a pandemic change a lot over time, and that uncertainty can add to fear and stress. The truth is that we don't know what will happen next—but that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot. You can: 
 Map out a daily schedule, including times you can connect with loved ones online or by phone 
 Plan out daily tasks and goals 
 Give yourself a schedule to look up current information 
 Make sure you have 14 days of healthy food and household supplies at home 
 Keep medications on hand and talk to your doctor for advice if you're at increased risk 
 Educate yourself on public health measures and figure out how you'll follow those instructions 
 Figure out how you'll manage increased childcare demands, working for home, or other changes to your usual routine 
 Determine if you'll need financial supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or BC Temporary Rent Supplement if your job is affected by COVID-19. If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time 
 Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care provider 
 Look for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community 
 Some planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action. This is a great time to practice problem-solving skills. Problem-solving is a method that helps you break down a complicated situation into manageable pieces, look for realistic and unbiased information, brainstorm possible solutions, and test the solutions that you think might work well. Problem-solving is a helpful skill no matter what else is going on in the world, and it's an empowering, methodical approach when you might otherwise feel overwhelmed or lost.

How can I maintain social connections? What if I feel lonely?,"A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. 
 While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear. 
 Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. 
 Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. 
 The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. 
 Everyone feels lonely at times—maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. 
 Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. 
 Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. 
 Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone. To find community services in BC, call or text 211 or visit www.bc211.ca. 
 If you need extra support, you can talk with a psychologist or counsellor for free:

How can I take care of my physical health?,"Taking care of your physical health is also good for your mental health. It's more important than ever to keep yourself healthy. 
 Try to eat as well as you can. It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, don’t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables—we still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time. 
 If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus. 
 Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed. 
 If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures—they're just keeping everyone safe.) 
 If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment. 
 Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits. For more, check out Wellness Module 6: Getting a Good Night's Sleep at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-6-getting-a-good-nights-sleep. 
 If you have other health problems like a chronic illness, check in with your doctor or health care team to see if you need to take any additional measures or precautions. Remember to plan ahead and do what you can to keep prescription or over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, supplements, or other health needs on hand."
How can I use distraction to manage difficult thoughts or feelings?,"Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated. 
 If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project. 
 If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more. 
 When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family—whoever takes the most language classes wins! 
 Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing—your own health is important."
How can I reframe the situation and find more balanced perspectives?,"How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours. 
 When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.) 
 People often overestimate the negative parts—their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself—and underestimate positive parts—their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. 
 How does the thought ""We're never going to make it through this!"" make you feel? It likely doesn't feel good—and it isn't even true. 
 Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. 
 Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? 
 Here are a few example: 
 ""I'm so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!"" 
 ""I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness."" 
 ""I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring."" 
 ""I'm doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy."" 
 ""I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating."" 
 ""I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I'm home more, I'll have more time to finish the projects I haven't touched in months and I'm excited to see the end results. 
 ""I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now."" 
 ""It makes sense that I feel scared—people are getting sick and we don't know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I'm going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable."" 
 ""We're going to be stuck inside forever. I'm already sick of this."" 
 ""I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal."" 
 The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there's a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now."
How can I challenge thinking traps?,"What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects—this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. 
 These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. 
 Here are some common thinking traps: 
 Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like ""always"" or ""never."" 
 I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it’s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! 
 Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. 
 I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! 
 Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. 
 I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! 
 Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. 
 I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick. 
 Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. 
 I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. 
 Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. 
 I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. 
 Telling yourself how you ""should"" or ""must"" act. 
 I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! 
 Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. 
 Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. 
 This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. 
 Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: 
 What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. 
 What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? 
 What are your emotions? How do you feel? 
 What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? 
 Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. 
 The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: 
 Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, ""I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!"" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, ""Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?"" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. 
 Ask yourself, ""Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?"" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. 
 Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, ""Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem."" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. 
 Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. 
 Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example: 
 I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. 
 I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this! 
 Labeling 
 'Should' statements 
 Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. 
 It's okay to feel upset right now—there's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together.

How can I manage grief?,"While a lot of people think of grief in terms of losing a person or pet, grief can come up whenever you lose something important. This includes: 
 Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent 
 Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures 
 Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19 
 Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation 
 Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal 
 Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future 
 Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings 
 Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again. 
 Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. 
 Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art. 
 Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait. 
 Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other. 
 Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities. 
 Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. 
 Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor—many now offer online or phone appointments.

You can also see a family doctor at a local walk-in clinic, though it’s helpful to find a regular doctor if you have ongoing care needs. You can also find a psychiatrist through the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC. Be aware that you almost always need a doctor’s referral to see a psychiatrist.

How can I see a psychiatrist?,"A psychiatrist is a specialist doctor. In BC, you need to ask your doctor for a referral. If you don't see a regular family doctor, you can ask any doctor at a walk-in clinic for a referral. 
 In some cases, you may be able to ""self-refer"" or make an appointment with a mental health program yourself, but that may not get you access to a psychiatrist. Contact your local mental health centre to see what's available in your area. You can search for mental health centres at www.gov.bc.ca/mentalhealth. If you need help finding your local mental health centre, call HealthlinkBC at 811 or visit www.healthlinkbc.ca and use the Find Health Service tool."
How can I see a psychologist?,"To find a Registered Psychologist, visit the BC Psychological Association. You can make an appointment on your own. You don’t need a doctor’s referral to see a psychologist. 
 Registered Psychologists are not usually covered by MSP, so you’ll have to pay for the cost of the appointment yourself. Workplace extended health benefits or Employee (Family) Assistance Programs may cover some costs. Some psychologists offer a sliding scale based on your income. If you’re facing financial hardship, you can ask when you make the appointment. 
 If you want to learn more about lower-cost options to access counselling (though not usually by Registered Psychologists), email us with your location and our information and referrals team can see what options there may be in your community.

How can I find a support group?,"Support groups are a way for people with a common experience to help each other and learn from each other. There are support groups for people with any experience of mental illness, support groups for people with a specific diagnosis, support groups for family members and friends, and more. 
 Support groups are offered by community organizations, mental health service providers, schools, campuses, and support agencies. Here are some general resources to help you find a mental health or substance use related support group in BC: 
 Talk to your mental health care provider. They might be able to make recommendations. 
 The Mood Disorders Association of BC offers a network of peer support groups around the province for people who experience mental illnesses like mood disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder. They also have groups for family and friends. Groups are drop-in. 
 Many Canadian Mental Health Association branches offer support services, including support groups. If your local branch doesn’t have their own program, they can recommend other services in your community. 
 The BC Schizophrenia Society maintains a directory of support groups and other regular events for family members of people with a mental illness. 
 For groups related to alcohol or drug use, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441 or 604-660-9382 in the Lower Mainland. 
 For groups in the Lower Mainland, search the Red Book Online. 
 If you are at school or on campus, talk to a school counsellor or your campus’ health and wellness office. 
 For online support, see some suggestions at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/discuss. This can be particularly useful if you don’t have a group in your community or have trouble getting to an in-person group. 
 In order to benefit the most from a support group, you need to feel safe enough to share your experiences and thoughts, and you need to feel comfortable supporting others. It can be helpful to contact the group facilitator or organizer ahead of time to see if a particular group might be a good fit for you. We have a checklist to help you evaluate support groups—including when it might be time to leave one. 
 Sometimes a group just doesn’t work for you, and that’s okay. If you feel comfortable, you can try talking to the facilitator to see if they can recommend another group that you can try."
Where can I find child and youth mental health services?,"To find help for a child or youth, you can: 
 Encourage your child to talk to a teacher or school counsellor 
 Talk to your family doctor or pediatrician, or go to a walk-in clinic

Where can older adults find help for mental health concerns?,"Mental health concerns are a serious concern at any age, and everyone deserves help and support. If you’re concerned about your mental health, you can: 
 Talk to your family doctor or go to a walk-in clinic 
 Call the Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) for information about services in your area

 Find resources from the Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health at www.ccsmh.ca 
 Find info sheets in the Seniors and Depression Series at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/factsheet/seniors-and-depression-series 
 If you are concerned about a loved one: 
 Be honest about your concerns, like changes you’ve noticed or problems that have come up 
 Give your loved one a chance to talk about their perspectives. They may have a different take on the problem or have different priorities in their health care 
 Be patient—it will probably take more than one conversation 
 Whenever possible, aim for cooperation. Focus on finding an action or solution that everyone can agree on 
 Remember that asking for help is hard for many of us, and it can be even harder as people’s roles and abilities change. If your loved one isn’t willing to talk about their experiences with you right away, offer alternatives like the BC Mental Health Support Line (310-6789—no area code needed), the Seniors Distress Line (604-872-1234) or a local seniors support organization (search for organizations at www.bc211.ca) 
 Seek support to manage your expectations and your own well-being. It can be very stressful to see a loved one experience health problems. But adults who can care for themselves and aren’t at risk of harm are free to make their own choices—and that includes refusing help"
Where can I find self-help materials for depression?,"Self-help resources are not a substitute for diagnosis or treatment. If you have concerns about low mood, it’s best to talk to your doctor first and rule out physical causes for your symptoms.

Where can I find free or low-cost counselling?,"Mental health services like counselling or therapy may be covered by your BC Medical Services Plan (MSP) when you access the service through a hospital or mental health clinic. Find your local health authority to learn more about counselling services in your area. HealthLink BC’s Find Services tool and Locator app can also help you find services. You often need a doctor’s referral to access these types of programs. 
 Without a doctor’s referral, you need to access care through the private system, which is not funded by the government. Private mental health services can be expensive. This can be a real barrier to finding good care. While there is no simple answer, there are several different places you can look: 
 If you have health benefits at work, ask about your coverage. Some plans will cover a certain number of private counselling or therapy sessions. In addition, a workplace Employee/Family Assistance Plan may offer some services or may refer you to community services. 
 Some psychologists, clinical counsellors, or other service providers may offer a sliding scale, which means that their costs are based on your income. Try contacting service providers directly to ask if they offer a sliding scale. One private clinic in Vancouver has a good list of lower-cost counselling options in the Vancouver area. For those outside of the Lower Mainland, you can still look at this list and see if any similar organizations might be in your community. 
 Contact a mental health organization like Anxiety Canada, the Canadian Mental Health Association, BC Schizophrenia Society, Institute of Families for Child and Youth Mental Health, Mood Disorders Association of BC, or Jessie’s Legacy. They may offer services in your area, or they may have local connections that they can refer you to. 
 You can also email us and we’ll try and give you some recommendations for your community."
Can I get help paying for prescription medications?,"BC PharmaCare covers the cost of some medications through Plan G, the Psychiatric Medications Plan, for people who need a medication to be well but cannot afford them. Your doctor or nurse practitioner must apply for your coverage on your behalf. Coverage usually lasts for one year, and then you can reapply if needed. Talk to your care team if you’re interested in Plan G."
How can I pay for mental health care?,"Mental health services provided through the government-run (‘public’) system, like services you receive through your local mental health centre or team, an outpatient psychiatry at a hospital are most often completely covered by MSP. As long as you are eligible for MSP, you won’t have to pay to see someone. 
 For mental health services that aren’t covered by MSP, such as psychotherapy or counselling with a private practitioner, you will have to cover the costs yourself. It’s no secret that these services can be expensive, but you may be able to offset the costs through: 
 Extended health coverage from your own or an immediate family member’s workplace benefits 
 Employee (Family) Assistance Program from your own or an immediate family member’s workplace benefits 
 For students, school or campus mental health services 
 For Indigenous community members, services offered through your Band, Friendship Centre, Indigenous support organization, or the First Nations Health Authority 
 Cultural or faith communities may offer some mental health services 
 You may be able to claim some larger costs related to treatment of a mental health condition on your income tax return under health expenses 
 Some providers offer lower-cost services or a sliding scale, usually based on your income. Email us with your location and our information and referrals team can help you look for options in your area. 
 If costs are a barrier to health care, talk to your doctor to see if there are any services in the public health system (covered by MSP) that may be a good fit for you. You can also called the Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) for more information on local mental health services."
How do I apply for income assistance?,"Provincial income assistance has three income levels: basic assistance (also called welfare), Persons with Disabilities benefits (PWD), and the Persons with Persistent and Multiple Barriers to employment benefits (PPMB). All are administered by the Ministry of Social Development and Social Inclusion. Depending on the situation, mental illness may considered under PWD or PPMB. Addictions may not be included in PPMB applications. 
 PWD benefits are for people who have a disability that prevents them from working or going about their daily activities. Find information from the Ministry and read a fact sheet from the Disability Alliance of BC with information about the application process. 
 PPMB benefits are for people who experience multiple barriers to work. Find information from the Ministry and read a fact sheet from the Disability Alliance of BC with information about the application process.

What is MSP?,"MSP stands for Medical Services Plan. It’s a health insurance program managed by the government for people who live in British Columbia, Canada. MSP pays for things like doctor’s appointments, appointments with specialist doctors like psychiatrists, and hospital stays you need to treat a medical problem. 
 Everyone who lives in BC must enroll in MSP. You pay a monthly fee based on your income. Some workplaces cover the costs of MSP fees for you. 
 Learn more about MSP here. If you have questions about applying for or managing your MSP coverage, call Health Insurance BC at 604 683-7151 in the Lower Mainland or 1-800-663-7100 in the rest of BC. They are open Monday – Friday from 8.00am – 4.30pm. You can also get help in person at your local Service BC office. 
 If you are new to BC, you have to wait three months before registering for MSP. 
 Bring your Care Card or BC Services Card with you when you go to medical appointments or use the pharmacy."
What is a referral?,"A referral means someone recommends you to another service. In health care, it usually means a request from your doctor to see a specialist like a psychiatrist. 
 To access any specialist in BC, you first need a referral. You may need to meet certain criteria, like a specific diagnosis or specific symptoms, to access some specialists. Your doctor can tell you what to expect. 
 Once your doctor has made the referral, the specialist’s office will contact you with an appointment time. Make sure your doctor’s office has your current contact information so the specialist can reach you. 
 The process is the same whether you see the same family doctor or visit a walk-in clinic. 
 Not all mental health programs in BC require a doctor’s referral. This is good news for people who are looking for help! A ""self-referral"" means that you ask to see someone, and then you will be evaluated to see if you meet the criteria to receive services. Contact your local health authority to learn more about programs in your area:"
