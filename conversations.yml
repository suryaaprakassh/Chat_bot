If a doctor prescribes antibiotics, it is highly necessary to complete the full course. If you stop taking the antibiotics midway, your body will create antibiotic-resistant bacteria. So, in future, if you are prescribed antibiotics for any illness, some of them might not work for you due to the presence of the resistant bacterias in your body.

  - The most important part of treatment is rehydration to replace fluid loss. This can be done through oral rehydration therapy (drinking a solution of water, salt, and sugar) or intravenous fluid replacement in severe cases. Antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin, can be used to shorten the duration of the illness and reduce the amount of cholera bacteria in the body. It is also important to practice good hygiene and sanitation to prevent the spread of cholera to others.

Resting is important for the body to recover from the illness. Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using insect repellents and wearing long-sleeved clothing. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and plasma exchange may be required to stabilize the patient's condition.In case of severe dengue, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.
